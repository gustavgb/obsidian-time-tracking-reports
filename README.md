# obsidian-time-tracking-reports

Dataview script used to aggregate time tracking entries into a table showing weekly entries grouped by date and monthly entries grouped by week number.

Simply paste the contents of [reports.md](./reports.md) into any Obsidian note and make sure [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) is installed. 

Make sure to set your preferred locale in the line that says `moment.locale('da')`. This will change date formatting and make sure that the week number is correct.
